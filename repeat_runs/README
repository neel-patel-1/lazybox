This directory contains scripts for repeated 1) running of experiments
constructed with a number of main workloads having multiple variants and
several background workloads including profilers, 2) organizing the output of
the workloads for each run, and 3) generating reports from the repeated runs.

For that, this directory contains two main scripts, `run.sh` and `post.sh`.
`run.sh` does run the required workloads and organize the outputs in a file
under hierarchical directories.  `post.sh` get numbers by parsing the outputs,
make stat (average, min, max, stdev) of the numbers for the repeated runs, and
generate human readable reports.

Each experiment is identified by its 'name' and 'variant'.  You should be able
to know what workloads should run for the 'name'.  'variant' is only for
organization of the outputs.

Files for each experiment
=========================

Nonetheless, the essential parts of each experiements should be implemented by
users by themeselves.  They should implement some executable files and place
those under specific directory with specific name.

`<exp name>/runners/`
---------------------

Place executable files each running different workload for the experiment.  The
name of the executables should be `(start|main|back|end)_*`.  Each of the files
will be executed as `(start|main_back_end)` workload, as defined by lazybox
`run_exps.py`.  The files will be sorted by the name using `sort` command and
be described to the `run_exps.py` in the order.

Each of the runners receives the output directory for this run as an argument.
The outputs containing information for the final report should be stored in the
directory as a file.

`<exp name>/parsers/`
---------------------

Place executable files each parsing different raw output files made by your
runners (executable files under `<exp name>/runners/*`).  The name of the
executable file should be matched with one of the raw output files.  For each
output file, the parser matched with the name will be executed.

Each of the parsers receives the path to the raw output files and the path to
the directory that parsed outputs should be stored.  The parsed data ashould be
placed under the directory as a file.


`<exp name>/stats/`
-------------------

Place executable files each generating stat of the parsed outputs for each of
the repeated runs.  The name of the executable file should be matched with one
of the parsed output files.  For each parsed output file, the stat executable
file matched with the name will be executed.  If not file matching with the
name exists, average, minimum, maximu, and standard deviation of the parsed
outputs will be generated.  If the parsed file format is different with the
default stat assumption, stat will not be generated.

Each of the stat generator receives the path to the stats directory and the
paths to the parsed files directories.
